AuditLogger
===========

AuditLogger is a plugin that is intended to make lifecycle logging of ActiveResource objects easy. 
The main goals of audit logger are:

* Setup should be super easy
* The database structure should be limited to helping access data
* Changing the attributes of the model does not affect the plugin
* Easy to implement data retention plan

Example
=======

$ script/generate audit_loggger AuditLogEntry
$ rake db:migrate

Then add the following line to any model you want to have logged

 uses_audit_logger("AuditLogEntry")

Restart your app and any changes to an object from that model will be logged.
